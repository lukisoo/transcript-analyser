Speaker A: I was, um, thinking we could grab coffee later?
Speaker B: Oh, like, totally! That sounds great.
Speaker A: You know, I'm trying to cut back on caffeine though. It's been making me feel super anxious lately.
Speaker B: Yeah, I get that. Honestly, my sleep's been awful.
Speaker A: So, maybe tea then? Or just a walk?
Speaker B: I mean, that works too. I love walks, especially when the weather's nice.
Speaker A: Um, should we go around 4?
Speaker B: Ugh, I might be stuck in a meeting. My manager has been piling stuff on last minute.
Speaker A: That sucks. You've been looking kind of burnt out lately, to be honest.
Speaker B: Like, yeah, I feel that. I'm trying to keep it together.
Speaker A: We don't have to force it today. We can always do another time.
Speaker B: Actually... thanks. I needed that. Maybe just talking like this helps.
Speaker A: Of course. You know I'm always here - no pressure.
Speaker B: Totally. Let's aim for later this week. I appreciate you.
