Speaker A: I was, um, thinking we could grab coffee later?
Speaker B: Oh, like, totally! That sounds great.
Speaker A: You know, I’m trying to cut back on caffeine though.
Speaker B: Same here, but I can never resist a flat white.
Speaker A: So, maybe tea then? Or just a walk?
Speaker B: I mean, that works too! I love walks.
Speaker A: Um, should we go around 4?
Speaker B: Like, yeah, that’s perfect.
Speaker A: Awesome. I’ll meet you at the usual spot.
Speaker B: Great. You know, I’ve been looking forward to this.
Speaker A: Same. It’s always nice to catch up.
Speaker B: Totally. Let's make it a regular thing.
